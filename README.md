# Internet-Speed-Tester-UI-
This script can test the speed of your network connection and show you  weather it fast or not. But you can't convert this script to an exe(Because there was an error when I tried to do that).


The UI of this script can't stop resizing(kivy config-graphics). Because the speed-test package put some error when you try to do that.
